## Laptop_price_prediction


# Observation
This project demonstrates that we can use machine-learning techniques to predict laptop price effectively based on the input given by the user. We also found that there is a minimal error(Difference) between the predicted and actual price of a laptop. But it gave accurate results and the laptop corresponding to the predicted price had all specifications which were given to it as input. 

# Analysis
Following graphs compare the actual laptop prices with the predicted ones, they make it easy to see how close the model's predictions are to the real values. And they help us to compare the laptop models which are available in the same price range.

#Limitation
we have to accept that a perfect match between the actual prices and the predicted prices cannot be made and even not possible, especially at the end of the graph. This is because the model cannot include each and every factor that affects the laptop prices(these factors may be :- Build quality, Brand value, Rating, etc)
