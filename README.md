## Laptop_price_prediction


# Observation
This project demonstrates that we can use machine-learning techniques to predict laptop price effectively based on the input given by the user. We also found that there is a minimal error(Difference) between the predicted and actual price of a laptop. But it gave accurate results and the laptop corresponding to the predicted price had all specifications which were given to it as input.
